# 2048
The project is a challange to create a game without using OOP.

#### - Project Status: [Completed]
## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to showcase my understanding of C on a deep level by creating a "graphical game" (built with ncurses) without the use of objects or any OOP priciples.

### Built with
  * C
  * [ncurses](https://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ncurses/) 
  
## Project Description
The project aims to simulate the popular 2048 game, but created only using C and the ncurses library. Built in a robust manner, making good use of pointers, modularizing the code and totally avoiding any global variables.
The game has all the functions of the original, including undo, going back to previous states of the game.
As a bonus, the game is also able to play by itslef, in a pretty naive way, following a greedy style.

## Usage
If you want to compile and play with the code you will need the ncurses library, the code was made for and tested on Linux.
#### Keys
* Arrow Keys
* Q (as a back button in menus)
* u (undo)
* Enter (for selecting menu items)
